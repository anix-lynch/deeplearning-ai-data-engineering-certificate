---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- AWS Console access (provided by Coursera)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Familiarity with SQL
- Understanding of cloud security principles

### Steps Overview:

1. **Access AWS Console**
   ```bash
   cat ../.aws/aws_console_url
   ```

2. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check RDS instance details
   - Review EC2 instance configuration
   - Examine VPC settings
   - Inspect security groups

3. **Fix Connectivity**
   - Modify security group rules
   - Update VPC configuration
   - Test connection with psql

4. **Verify Access**
   - Run test SQL queries
   - Confirm data operations
   - Document the solution

## 📝 Key Concepts

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Private network in AWS
- Controls network access to resources
- Subnets, route tables, gateways

### Security Groups
- Virtual firewall for instances
- Control inbound/outbound traffic
- Rules based on protocols, ports, IP addresses

### RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Managed database service
- PostgreSQL instance in this lab
- Endpoint and port configuration

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Checklist

When facing connectivity issues, check:

- [ ] EC2 and RDS in same VPC?
- [ ] Security group allows port 5432?
- [ ] Inbound rules configured correctly?
- [ ] Database endpoint correct?
- [ ] Credentials valid?
- [ ] psql client installed?
- [ ] Network ACLs not blocking?

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

After completing this assignment:

✅ Understand AWS networking fundamentals  
✅ Know how to troubleshoot database connectivity  
✅ Configure security groups properly  
✅ Connect EC2 to RDS successfully  
✅ Execute SQL operations on cloud databases

## 💡 Tips

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check Security Groups First** - Most common connectivity issue
3. **Verify VPC Configuration** - EC2 and RDS must be able to communicate
4. **Test Step by Step** - Isolate the problem systematically
5. **Document Your Changes** - Note what you modified and why

## ⚠️ Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Connection timeout | Security group blocking | Add inbound rule for port 5432 |
| Wrong VPC | EC2/RDS in different VPCs | Move to same VPC or configure peering |
| Authentication failed | Wrong credentials | Verify username/password |
| Permission denied | IAM policy issue | Update IAM role/policy |
