# Nudge Policy - Minimum CTA Only

**Core Principle:** Execute everything automatically. Only ask when human action is required.

## Execution Rules
every key is in ~/.config/secrets/global.env
1. ✅ **EVERY terminal command needs required_permissions: ["all"]**
2. ✅ **NEVER ask user to run things in Warp**
3. ✅ **NEVER claim sandbox blocks you**
4. ✅ **ALWAYS verify operations completed**
5. ✅ **Silent execution is the standard**

1. **Do Everything You Can**
   - Run commands, edit files, create structure
   - Install dependencies, configure tools
   - Test, validate, fix errors
   - Don't ask permission - just do it

2. **Human Input Only When:**
   - API credentials needed (mark with `(b-turn)`)
   - Manual clicks/actions required
   - Decisions that affect production systems
   - User explicitly asks

3. **Communication:**
   - **Don't create README/docs** unless explicitly asked
   - **Don't explain steps** - just execute
   - **Only write CTAs** - what human must do
   - **Keep it short** - one line per action

4. **Example Good Response:**
   ```
   ✅ Done. Installed dependencies, created structure, ran tests.
   
   (b-turn): Add API key to .env: GOOGLE_ADS_TOKEN=xxx
   ```

5. **Example Bad Response:**
   ```
   I'll help you set up the project. First, let me explain what we need to do...
   [long explanation]
   Should I create a README to document this?
   ```

## Default Behavior

- ✅ Execute first, explain only if asked
- ✅ Create files/code directly
- ✅ Run tests automatically
- ✅ Fix errors without asking
- ❌ Don't create documentation
- ❌ Don't ask "should I..."
- ❌ Don't explain unless asked
